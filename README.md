# PubSub
PubSub is a simple "Hello World" example project, demonstrating how to subscribe to an Ethereum RPC provider and get notified every time a new block got mined.

This project depends on...
1. [Delphereum](https://github.com/svanas/delphereum), a web3 implementation for the Delphi programming language.
2. [eSeGeCe WebSockets](https://www.esegece.com/websockets), a WebSockets implementation for the Delphi programming language.
3. [OpenSSL](https://github.com/IndySockets/OpenSSL-Binaries) binaries version 1.0.2u (aka the latest version supported by the [Indy](https://www.indyproject.org/) project).

The very 1st time you run this project, it will prompt you for your ([Infura](https://infura.io/) or [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/)) API key. Enter your API key, close Notepad, and save changes to the TXT file. You are then good to go.
